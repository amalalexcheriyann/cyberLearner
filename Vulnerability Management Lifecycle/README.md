# 🛡️ Vulnerability Management & Hardening: Metasploitable 2 Project

## 📋 Executive Summary
This project demonstrates a full **Vulnerability Management Lifecycle**, simulating a real-world scenario of securing a compromised legacy Linux server ("Metasploitable 2"). 

Acting as a Security Engineer, I moved beyond simple exploitation ("Capture the Flag") to perform the complete defensive cycle: **Assessment, Validation, Remediation, and Verification**. I identified critical risks (CVSS 10.0), validated them through Proof-of-Concept exploits, and implemented permanent system-level fixes to harden the server against future attacks.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
| Category | Tools Used |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Assessment** | Tenable Nessus Essentials, Nmap |
| **Exploitation** | Metasploit Framework, Netcat (`nc`), VNCViewer |
| **Remediation** | Linux CLI (`sed`, `iptables`, `systemd`, `xinetd`, `netstat`) |
| **Environment** | Kali Linux (Attacker) vs. Metasploitable 2 (Target) |

## 🔍 Phase 1: Discovery (Assessment)
The engagement began with a network scan to map the attack surface, followed by a credentialed vulnerability scan to identify specific flaws.

**Key Findings:**
* [cite_start]**🚨 Port 1524 (Ingreslock):** A "Bind Shell" backdoor allowing unauthenticated root access[cite: 837].
* [cite_start]**🚨 Port 5900 (VNC):** Weak authentication configuration using the password "password"[cite: 380].
* [cite_start]**🚨 Port 6667 (UnrealIRCd):** A compromised IRC daemon containing a malicious backdoor[cite: 318].

## ⚔️ Phase 2: Validation (Exploitation)
To demonstrate business risk and rule out false positives, I performed ethical exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities.

### **1. Validating the "Bind Shell" (Port 1524)**
The most critical vulnerability was a listening shell on port 1524. Using Netcat, I verified that connecting to this port granted immediate **Root** privileges without a password.
```bash
nc 10.0.2.3 1524
whoami
# Output: root
